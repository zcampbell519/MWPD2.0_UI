				<h2>Wood Products Come from Good Forest Management</h2>

					<p>Active forest management promotes resilient forests and decreases the loss of trees to insects, disease, drought and wildfire.
				       Wood products play a critical role in completing this work, paying for treatments in the woods that make our forests healthy.</p>
                
					<p>Wood products from sustainably managed forests are our most renewable natural resource. Wood is the only renewable
				       major building material. And we’ve got lots of trees. Tree growth continues to exceed what is harvested in the U.S.
                       Manufactured wood from timber lands in Montana is a responsible building material.</p>
				   
					<ul>
						<li>Manufacturing wood is essentially a zero waste industry. Of the 111.4 million cubic feet (MMCF) of wood fiber harvested in Montana in 2014, less than 1% (0.024 MMCF) went unused (UM BBER).</li>
						<li>86% of the energy used by Montana mills is from renewable sources (biomass and hydropower)</li>
					</ul>
					
				<h2>Environmental Stewardship</h2>
				
					<p>Professionalism and a strong stewardship ethic govern forest practices in Montana. Foresters, accredited logging
					   professionals and mill workers care about forests as much as any of us. They take pride in protecting water quality, fish and
					   wildlife habitat. Their livelihood depends on the continued growth of trees and the responsible management of forestlands.</p>
				  
				    <ul>
						<li>98% of forest practices met or exceeded the standards of Best Management Practices in the 2018 BMP Field Review. The review measures the success in limiting non-point source pollution (from runoff in drainage basins).</li>
						<li>1.2 million acres of corporate-owned and managed timberland is third party certified for sustainable practices through the<a href="https://www.sfiprogram.org/">Sustainable Forestry Initiative.</a>    	
					</ul>

				<h2>Sustainable Forest Management</h2>
				
				<div>
				
					<p>Almost 100% of timber commercially harvested in Montana meets the guidelines of the<a href= "https://www.sfiprogram.org/">Sustainable Forestry Initiative.</a> 
					   All of the timber milled in Montana for building materials meets these guidelines.</p>  

				</div>

				<h2>Working Forests and Communities</h2>
				
					<p>Over 100 mills operate in Montana. Most are located in rural forested communities in the western part of the state. Of these
					   mills, 90% are small, processing less than 10 million board feet/year. A majority are family operations that have served their communities for many decades.</p><br style="line-height:3px;"/>
					<p>Seven larger sawmills remain in Montana. These mill operations process the majority of the wood in the state, and are tied to
					   many acres of restored forest. They are vital to maintaining the health of our forests. Thriving forests need a thriving forest
                       products industry to facilitate the stewardship work.</p><br style="line-height:3px;"/>
					   
					<p>A strong forest products industry means thriving communities too. Every million board feet delivered to a mill represents 18
					   jobs in manufacturing, logging and forest support services. More jobs are created in trucking. Money from businesses and
                       workers goes into the local economy, supporting more jobs and economic growth.</p>

				<h3>Support our Outdoor Lifestyle</h3>	

					<p>The labor force of Montana’s forestry sector preserves the outdoor lifestyle we value. Their skills maintain safe and accessible
					   trails, recreation areas and roadsides. Forestry practices also enhance fish and wildlife habitat. Managed forests promote
                       healthy growth and trees more resistant to disease and drought. Removal of hazardous fuels reduces wildfire risk on our
                       public lands and around our communities</p>
					   
					   
			    <h3>Timber Sales Benefit Montana Schools</h3>
				
					<p>The Montana DNRC and a statewide team of foresters, managers, hydrologists, biologists and planners work together to
					   manage over 780,000 acres of forested state trust lands. This management benefits the common schools and other
                       institutions in Montana. Revenue from the Forest Management Program, mainly from the sale of forest products, accounts
                       for about ten percent of the total revenue from the trust land,<a href= "http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/trust/docs/annual-report/fy2019_tlmd_presentation.pdf"> in 2018 more than $4 million went to schools.</a></p>
