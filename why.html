	<h1>BUY MONTANA WOOD FOR HEALTHIER FORESTS</h1>
	<h2>Wood Products Come from Good Forest Management</h2>
	<p>
		Active forest management promotes resilient forests and decreases the loss of trees to insects, disease,
		drought and wildfire. Wood products play a critical role in completing this work, paying for treatments in the
		woods that make our
		forests healthy.
	</p>

	<p>
		Wood products from sustainably managed forests are our most renewable natural resource. Wood is the only
		renewable major building material. And we’ve got lots of trees. Tree growth continues to exceed what is
		harvested in
		the U.S. Manufactured wood from timber lands in Montana is a responsible building material.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Manufacturing wood is essentially a zero waste industry. Of the 111.4 million cubic feet (MMCF) of wood
			fiber harvested in Montana in 2014, less than 1% (0.024 MMCF) went unused (UM BBER).
		</li>
		<li>
			86% of the energy used by Montana mills is from renewable sources (biomass and hydropower)
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Environmental Stewardship</h2>
	<p>
		Professionalism and a strong stewardship ethic govern forest practices in Montana. Foresters, accredited
		logging professionals and mill workers care about forests as much as any of us. They take pride in protecting
		water
		quality, fish and wildlife habitat. Their livelihood depends on the continued growth of trees and the
		responsible management
		of forestlands.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			98% of forest practices met or exceeded the standards of Best Management Practices in the 2018 BMP Field
			Review. The review measures the success in limiting non-point source pollution (from runoff in drainage
			basins).
		</li>
		<li>
			1.2 million acres of corporate-owned and managed timberland is third party certified for sustainable
			practices through the<a href="https://www.sfiprogram.org/">Sustainable Forestry Initiative.
			</a>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Sustainable Forest Management</h2>

	<p>
		Almost 100% of timber commercially harvested in Montana meets the guidelines of the
		<a href="https://www.sfiprogram.org/">Sustainable Forestry Initiative.</a>
		All of the timber milled in Montana for building materials meets these guidelines.
	</p>

	<h2>Working Forests and Communities</h2>

	<p>
		Over 100 mills operate in Montana. Most are located in rural forested communities in the western part of the
		state. Of these mills, 90% are small, processing less than 10 million board feet/year. A majority are family
		operations that
		have served their communities for many decades.
	</p>
	<p>
		Seven larger sawmills remain in Montana. These mill operations process the majority of the wood in the state,
		and are tied to many acres of restored forest. They are vital to maintaining the health of our forests. Thriving
		forests
		need a thriving forest products industry to facilitate the stewardship work.
	</p>

	<p>
		A strong forest products industry means thriving communities too. Every million board feet delivered to a
		mill represents 18 jobs in manufacturing, logging and forest support services. More jobs are created in
		trucking. Money from
		businesses and workers goes into the local economy, supporting more jobs and economic growth.

	<h3>Support our Outdoor Lifestyle</h3>
	<p>
		The labor force of Montana’s forestry sector preserves the outdoor lifestyle we value. Their skills maintain
		safe and accessible trails, recreation areas and roadsides. Forestry practices also enhance fish and wildlife
		habitat. Managed
		forests promote healthy growth and trees more resistant to disease and drought. Removal of hazardous fuels
		reduces wildfire
		risk on our public lands and around our communities
	</p>


	<h3>Timber Sales Benefit Montana Schools</h3>

	<p>
		The Montana DNRC and a statewide team of foresters, managers, hydrologists, biologists and planners work
		together to manage over 780,000 acres of forested state trust lands. This management benefits the common schools
		and
		other institutions in Montana. Revenue from the Forest Management Program, mainly from the sale of forest
		products, accounts for about ten percent of the total revenue from the trust land,
		<a href="http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/trust/docs/annual-report/fy2019_tlmd_presentation.pdf">
			in 2018 more than $4 million went to schools.
