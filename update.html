			<div>
                <p>Increased use of Montana Wood products has many benefits for all of usâ€”and especially for our forests. The Montana
				   Wood Products Directory was created to help Montanans identify local wood sources, locate and purchase available
				   wood products.</p>
            </div>
			
			<div>&nbsp;
                <p>If you represent a wood products manufacturer or supplier, make sure your contact, sales and product information are
				   shown accurately in the directory. Add a website or social network for consumers to learn more.</p>
