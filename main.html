            Wood is the only renewable major building material. Wood is also one of the few building
            materials with third-party certification to prove it came from a
            responsibly managed resource. Using local wood from sustainably managed forests makes a
            positive impact to our communities, economy and forests.

            The design and construction industry has a lot of interest in the use of cross-laminated
            timber (CLT). Cross-laminated timber is produced in Montana.
            CLT reduces the carbon footprint of construction and stores massive amounts of carbon as
            well. Find out how the cost savings of engineered wood panels
            can benefit your commercial or large-scale residential project. In addition to dimensional
            lumber, logs, and mass timber you can find siding, flooring,
            millwork and other materials for building and remodeling.
