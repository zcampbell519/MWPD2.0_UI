		<h1>Build With Renewable Montana Wood</h1>
		<h2>Natural Sustainable Construction Material</h2>	
		
		<p>Wood is the only major building material that is renewable.Wood also has hefty benefits in reducing carbon emissions, energy use and pollution compard to concrete and steel.
		   Wood is strong, durable, and resilient. Its a natural insulator and can help control humidity. Using local wood has direct benefits to your community and ensures the forested 
	       landscapes we love continue to be forested in the future.</p>

			<h2>Montana Forests and Trees</h2>
			<p>Forests cover about one-fourth of Montana’s land area. Ponderosa and lodgepole pine, Douglas fir, larch, grand fir, spruce,
			   western hemlock and western red cedar grow west of the Continental Divide. Timber stands of primarily ponderosa pine are
               found on the drier east side of the state. Deciduous native species include box elder, paper birch, green ash, balsam poplar,
               cottonwood, aspen, buckthorn, willow and elm.</p>
			<h3><a href="pdf/DNRC-19901_GlossaryPage_TitlePage.pdf" id="glossary" >Learn about Montana trees and CLT in our Glossary</a></h3>
			<h2>What if your building supply store doesn’t carry Montana Wood?</h2>
			<p>The remaining 7 large mills in the state are wholesale operations. The sale of milled wood goes through a broker who can
			   choose any source. Ask your supplier or your contractor to offer Montana-grown lumber. When you choose Montana wood,
               you support healthy forests and defend our clean air and water.</p>
			<h2>Look for these Montana wood products.</h2>   
			 <P>Product categories include: bark; boat building; cabinets and counter tops; cedar; engineered wood products; fuelwood;
			    furniture; furniture and fixtures; independent artist, primary logs; independent artist, secondary wood; log furniture; log
                home; millwork, doors and windows; pallets, stakes and containers; particle board/MDF; plywood/veneer; post/pole;
                prefabricated buildings; primary wood; sawmill; secondary wood; signs; specialty wood products; and sporting goods (such
                as bows and gunstocks).</P>   
			
			   
			<h2>CLT</h2> 	   
		<p>Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is produced in Montana at Smartlam North America in Columbia Falls, a globally recognized manufacturer. 
	      CLT consists of large fire-resistant solid wood panels. Layers of long and short boards are glued in alternating right angles and bonded 
	      under tons of pressure. CLT is engineered to have inherent load-bearing strength. Montana's Douglas fir and larch provide strong wood ideal 
	      for CLT. The market for mass timber is rapidly expanding across the U.S. but Montana builders have the advantage of using wood from local sources.</p>	   
		<h1>MASS TIMBER CONSTRUCTION </h1>	   
		<p>Mass timber construction offers many benefits compared with concrete and steel. 	   
		<h2>Reduced Construction Time, Reduced Costs</h2>	   
		<p>Using engineered mass timber often results in reduced foundation costs and a shorter finance period. Large timber panels are 
	       assembled off-site, so buildings go up faster. Labor costs go down because of speed of construction.</p>	   
		<h2>Safer Work Site</h2>	   
		<p>Wood is lighter and may be less hazardous than concrete and steel. It produces less work site waste. Solid wood floor assemblies
		   mean interior work can begin sooner on lower floors as the building goes up.</p>

	  <p>All of the wood construction and finishing products made in Montana provide opportunities to showcase the strength and versatility of 
         wood and Montana's forests in a building-while storing carbon.</p>
	  <p>Mass Timber products like CLT can turn commercial buildings into massive carbon storage units. Wood construction creates far less carbon 
	     emissions than concrete and steel. Construction with mass timber is a booming trend for these reasons. <em id="mass">Mass timber</em> is a class of wood materials
	     in which smaller pieces of wood are joined to create large solid wood structural units for wall, floor, and roof construction. Mass timber 
	     construction is ideal for mid-rise construction, and can be used to build up to 18 stories.</p>
       <p>Changing the way we build our cities can substantially reduce the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Tall, multi-story timber 
	     buildings of ten or more stories are going up all over the world, changing the way we think about construction. Wood from sustainably managed 
	     forests is transforming campuses and cityscapes for a more sustainable future.</p>
