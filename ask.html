    <h1>ASK FOR RENEWABLE WOOD GROWN IN MONTANA</h1>
    <h2>Hundreds of Uses</h2>

    <p>It’s logs and posts, timber frames, trusses and 2x4s, and much, much more; wood products sold
        in Montana include a long
        list of uses for building interiors as well as exteriors and landscaping. Montana boasts one
        of the few U.S. manufacturers of
        innovative, engineered wood that is part of the rapidly expanding mass timber trend in
        building construction.</p>
    <p>Dozens of small mills and wood working shops turn out furniture and other unique pieces for
        homeowners. You can find
        signs, picture frames, musical instruments, bows, gunstocks, and watercraft—all made in
        Montana.</p>
    <p>Don’t forget Montana-made products for your pellet stove or fireplace. Various manufacturers
        in the state offer firelogs,
        pellets or chips.</p>

    <h2>Slower-growing, Tighter Grain, Stronger Wood</h2>

    <p>Lumber milled from Montana’s renewable softwoods tends to be stronger than softwood lumber
        from the south and
        coastal Pacific northwest. Our long Montana winters keep the growing season short, which
        means slower-growing trees.
        The slower growth creates a tighter grain. This tighter grain has both increased strength
        and visual appeal</p>

    <h2>Montana Forests and Trees</h2>
    <p>Forests cover about one-fourth of Montana’s land area. Ponderosa and lodgepole pine, Douglas
        fir, larch, grand fir, spruce,
        western hemlock and western red cedar grow west of the Continental Divide. Timber stands of
        primarily ponderosa pine are
        found on the drier east side of the state. Deciduous native species include box elder, paper
        birch, green ash, balsam poplar,
        cottonwood, aspen, buckthorn, willow and elm.</p>

    <h2>What if your building supply store doesn’t carry Montana Wood?</h2>
    <p>The remaining 7 large mills in the state are wholesale operations. The sale of milled wood
        goes through a broker who can
        choose any source. Ask your supplier or your contractor to offer Montana-grown lumber. When
        you choose Montana wood,
        you support healthy forests and defend our clean air and water.</p>
