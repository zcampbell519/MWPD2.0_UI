  <h2>ABOUT MONTANA WOOD PROMOTION</h2>
  <p>
    The promotion of Montana Wood Products is one element of an overall strategy to improve the health and resilience of Montana’s forests. 
    Montana forests are in critical condition. Trees are packed so densely that entire forests are at risk of loss to catastrophic fire, insects, disease outbreak, 
    and drought.
  </p>


  <p>
     While the health of forests has declined, sustainable management and a diverse forest products industry offer solutions.
		Active management will help restore our forests. But the work can’t be done without a strong industry framework, including
		sawmills and manufacturers to offset the cost of these treatments. Increased purchase and use of wood products will
        support the industry, strengthen Montana communities, sustain our forests, and help reduce the impact of wildfires.
  </p>


  <p>
    Buy Montana Wood is designed to show the ecological and economic benefits of using Montana wood products.

    invites innovation. It stores carbon. Wood in the built environment is beautiful and improves the well-being of people who
    live with it. And it is grown locally.

  <h3>About the Montana Wood Products Directory</h3>

  <p>The directory helps you source wood materials produced here. In Montana, people feel a special connection with the state,
    its natural beauty and mystique. Buying local is a simple action to nurture that special connection with Montana forests.
      What is true for food and small business is also true for wood products: local is more sustainable. Buying Montana-sourced
      wood products strengthens our communities, encourages more sustainable construction, reduces carbon emissions, and
      improves the health and resilience of our forests.</p>
  <p>The Montana Wood Products Directory is provided by the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and
    the University of Montana Bureau of Business and Economic Research. Business listings and profiles in this directory are
      populated with information from the Montana Manufacturing Information System (MMIS) maintained by the University of
      Montana Bureau of Business and Economic Research and the Made in Montana product directory maintained by the
      Montana Department of Commerce.</p>    
    <p>Support for this directory was provided by the Montana Wood Products Association and the Montana Forest Product Roundtable. 
      Funding for its development was provided in part by the USDA Forest Service.</p>
